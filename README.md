# Consignment Delivery System by python

## Overview
This project enables users to choose between two roles: **Delivery Partner** or **Customer**. It helps customers send consignments and provides an easy way for delivery partners to receive, deliver, and track consignments. Customers can provide feedback, and delivery partners can view the feedback related to each package.

## Features

### As a Customer:
1. **Fill your details:**  
   Enter your name, contact information, and other relevant details required for the delivery.

2. **Select Location:**  
   Choose the location to send your consignment. The application will check if the location is valid for delivery.

3. **Check if the consignment is fragile:**  
   Select whether the consignment is fragile. This will notify the delivery partner that extra care is needed.

4. **Provide Feedback:**  
   After the delivery, you can give feedback and rate the delivery process.

### As a Delivery Partner:
1. **Receive Packages:**  
   Delivery partners will receive packages with customer details and consignment information.

2. **View Feedback:**  
   After the delivery is completed, the delivery partner can view customer feedback and ratings.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The backend logic of the system is implemented in Python, managing customer details, delivery operations, and feedback.
- **Additional Technologies**: (Feel free to mention other relevant technologies like Flask, Django, or any database, etc.)

   - Fill in your personal details (name, address, phone number).
